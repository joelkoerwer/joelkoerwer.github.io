A blog about math, optics, chess and perhaps a few other things.
This post is a reminder to me of what I've commited to putting in the first few posts.

  1. Get started. Set up Jekyll.
  2. Set up and test chess.js and chessboard.js.
  3. Set up and test d3.js.
  4. Make a simple js/DOM 2D graphing libray. D3 plugin?
  5. Put up what I've got so far on chess statistics.
  6. Analyze performance vs Elo rating for some database. Probably ICOfY
  7. Opening explorer.
  8. Disqus, github feedback, etc.
